                Parcel B exists to support and share in the creation and ongoing 
                success of companies founded by people who have attended 
                Olin College of Engineering.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our pursuit of this fund is an act of conviction in the Olin 
                educational model and the people who emerge from it.
            </p>

                Parcel B is the undeveloped plot of land that sits next to Olin's 
                campus. It's the undefined, the messy, and the wild where we do some 
                of our best learning and best creation.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Parcel B began as a loose collective of alumni in 2017, 
                investing in various Olin founded startups and hosting small 
                community spaces and fellowships. We became a formalized fund 
                as of 2024 to make involvement easier and more accessible, 
                while allowing us to better leverage and gather resources for 
                the founders we support.
